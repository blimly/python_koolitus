# Tasks for INIT
## Basic tasks 
- [ ] Snake behind
- [ ] Changing difficulty
- [ ] Background

### Snake behind
Currently the snake hides the trees and apples, make it so that the trees and apples are always shown and that the snake is "behind" them
### Changing difficulty
Make the game speed up as the snake gets larger, but the relation should be something a bit more complicated than linear and it should be fun to play
### Background
Add a background image to the game. You can also define programmatically some pattern to fill the background, but it should be more interesting than just one colour.

## Advanced tasks
- [ ] Background music
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Animated background
- [ ] Random trees

### Background music
Add background music that is played on a loop all of the time
### Sound effects
Add sound effects for when an apple gets eaten and for when the game ends
### Animated background
Make your background (or some components of it) move
### Random trees
Make the length, width and direction of each child tree vary randomly, to make the trees more organic.

> Bonus points if you record your own sound effects

## Expert tasks
- [ ] Pretty snake
- [ ] Add menu screen
- [ ] Add local multiplayer

### Pretty snake
The snake's head and tail need to have a unique appearance and also every turn that the snake has, needs to look like a turn (smooth corners or matching png)
### Add menu screen
There should be a menu screen that is open first and from there the user should be able to select different gamemodes (currently there is only one gamemode). Also, when the game ends, then it should come back to the menu screen, not close immediately. It might be a good idea to try to add some new classes for this. If you have music, then the menu screen should have different music than the main game
### Add local multiplayer
There should be 2 snakes, one controlled with arrow keys, one with WASD. Make them different colours and come up with a unique and fun mechanic / logic of what happens when the snakes run into each other
